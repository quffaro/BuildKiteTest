# Sonnet XVII, Stanza 3

I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where,   
I love you directly without problems or pride:
I love you like this because I donâ€™t know any other way to love,
except in this form in which I am not nor are you,   
so close that your hand upon my chest is mine,   
so close that your eyes close with my dreams.

*Neruda*
